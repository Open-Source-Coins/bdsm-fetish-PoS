News
===================

Cryptopia Exchange kicked us off by pretending I had requested to be removed. I had said it was okay to remove WHIPPED if they desired, not that I specifically desire they remove it. Verbal abuse followed when I pointed that out ...

Of 850,000 stated coins on the Explorer, 300,000 were destroyed, 20,000 accidently deleted by me and 100,000 remain somewhere at Cryptopia.

That results in about 430,000 WHIPPED available, nearly half of the coin count.
